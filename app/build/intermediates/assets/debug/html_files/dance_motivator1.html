<P>"I'll run up the stairs 10 times in a row, every morning!" Sure. You'll do it, Fabulous Traveler. Maybe once or twice, or maybe you can even keep it up for a week.</P>
<P>But then what happens? </P>
<P>In the first case, you fall off the wagon a few days later, dreading this monster awaiting you every morning. </P>
<P>In the second case, and this happens when you've been successful for a few days, you'll give yourself what scientists call a moral license: since you've been doing so great these last few days, a treat or two today is something you deserve, so let's skip exercising, and let's even indulge in eating this cookie today. </P>
<P>Something else now happens, what scientists call by the funky name the "What the hell effect". What the hell, I already ate donuts, didn't exercise today, so let's just go for this glass of wine, this one cigarette, and this last doughnut! Too late. You'll now need weeks to get yourself out of the "What the hell effect".</P>
<H3>How can you avoid this chain reaction?</h3>
<P>Don't start big. </P>
<P>Choose an exercise that's simple to do. Instead of doing 20 push-ups, just say to yourself that you're going to do 5. Instead of running 20 minutes, just say to yourself, I'm going out for a 5-minute walk. Then, once these habits are in place, you can look further down the road. </P>
<P>As soon as you fall off, go back to the basics: 5 push-ups or a small walk in the countryside. This is always enough! </P>
