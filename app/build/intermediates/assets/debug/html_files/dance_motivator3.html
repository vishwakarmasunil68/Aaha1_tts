<p>
Do you know that you&srquo;re already getting onto a treadmill every morning? </P>
<p>
This might sound surprising, as you can swear to me that no, you don't even have a treadmill. </P>
<p>
And yet, you do. Every morning you get on this treadmill called life. </P>
<p>
Things starts pouring on you from everywhere demanding your attention. You think you're in control, but most of the time, you're just reacting to what's happening around you. Your children need to go to school, colleagues send you emails, Facebook notifications, etc. </P>

<p>
There remains, though, a time where you have a complete and full control of yourself, where you can have your own Secret Garden. </P>
<p>The Rising Morning</P>
<p>
If you wake up, just a little earlier than your family, you can have a full 30-minute segment for yourself, to do whatever you choose to do. </P>
<p>
You can decide to exercise. And nothing can stop you. For 5 minutes, for 30 seconds, you're going to move, and dance, and play, and no one can rob you of this moment for yourself. </P>
<p>
We have much more control over our morning than over the rest of our day. You've already experienced this. Finding time for exercise is very difficult during the day. You have so many other priorities that exercising doesn't seem to be of any importance. </P>
<p>
No amount of motivation will make up for it: you have real-life priorities, such as needing to complete a project on time, going to the dentist, etc. </P>
<p>
If your boss is looking at you waiting for your project output, you can't just tell him: "Hey, boss, I'll hand this project in later today, because I have my exercise session now. This is good for the morale of the company. Don't think short term, think long term, boss." </P>
<p>
Ahh, when reality kicks in. </P>
