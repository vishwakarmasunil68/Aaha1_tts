<p>
Fabulous Traveler, in your journey towards behavior change, making the habit very easy to do is the most important part. </p>
The more difficult it is to start the habit, the less likely you are to adopt it.
<p>Remember the last time you planned to exercise the next morning. After resolving to exercise the night before, you woke up in the morning and thought while still lying in bed, “Where did I put my gym clothes? Are they clean ? Where are my running shoes? Hmmm, too complicated. Sleeping is easier”. </p>
And once again, you decided to postpone exercise because you were unprepared.
<p>Imagine now if your running shoes were just next to your bed, you'll have fewer excuses not to start. </p>
<p>You don’t want to fall into this trap. </p>
<p>Take a few minutes today to prepare yourself properly for your first three days of great breakfasts. </p>
