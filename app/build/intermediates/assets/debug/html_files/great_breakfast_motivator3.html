<p>Good morning Fabulous Traveler, </p>
<p>Nothing’s like a good and healthy breakfast to begin your day and make it brighter. But as time goes by quicker in the morning, here are four delicious recipes easy to make and to transport. </p>
<h3>Fruit and Yogurt Parfait</h3>
<p>This is a very healthy choice and gives you no excuses to skip breakfast. </p>
<p>Choose plain or flavored yogurt, add fruit and any topping you wish. Fruits in season are sweeter, healthier and less expensive. This summer, opt for peaches or cherries, and for apples when fall comes. </p>
<h3>Frozen Banana & Peanut Butter Smoothie</h3>
<p>The name itself sounds delicious, the taste is even better. </p>
<p>Place a frozen pealed banana, 1 cup almond or soy milk (both of which stay fresh longer when not refrigerated and is great for lactose intolerant people), 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, preferably natural, along with a handful of ice cubes into a blender. You may add a scoop of vanilla or chocolate protein powder for added flavor and an energy boost if you like. Blend for about a minute until it’s a smooth, thick liquid. </p>
<p>To use as a morning snack for after your workout or at the office, pour into a tightly sealed container and carry it in your gym bag, purse or briefcase. If you’re making this for an afternoon energy boost prepare it well ahead of time and place in the freezer the night before. </p>
<p>Although it’ll be frozen in the morning there will be plenty of time for it to thaw out before enjoying it for lunch. What a great way to wake up in the morning knowing you’ve prepared this treat. </p>
<h3>	Avocado Toast with Egg</h3>
<p>It’s quick, healthy and delicious. </p>
<p>All you need is an avocado, two slices of lightly toasted whole-grain bread and two eggs for protein. Slice and spread the avocado on the toast and top with two fried or scrambled eggs and a little salt and pepper. </p>
<p>Place them in a plastic container with a lid and you’re out the door with a healthy breakfast to fill you up and get you started for the day. Or slap them together to make a sandwich instead. It’s tasty, nutritious and easy to eat on-the-go. </p>
<p>You will never forget breakfast again.</p>
