<p>Greetings Aaha Traveler, </p>

<p>I hope you successfully drank water first thing in the morning for the last 3 days. </p>

<p>If you didn’t succeed, we’d love to hear why. Just hit reply, and remember you can do this anytime you have a question. We’re here to help. </p>

<p>
Do you realize something, Fabulous Traveler? </p>

<h3>You've started to change.</h3>
<p>You are now drinking water as soon as you wake up. Perhaps this is something you’d already been doing in an inconsistent manner. </p>

<p>
Now, you created a habit out of it. </p>

<p>
So we can safely make this assumption : Behavior Change is a learnable skill, and you can learn it . </p>

<p>
Now, imagine the benefits of adding other tiny healthy habits to your life. </p>

<p><mark>
Soon, all these tiny habits will sum up to create the new, Fabulous You.</mark></p>
<h3>The most important way to start the day</h3>
<p>A healthy breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This fuels and energizes you as the day wears on. </p>

<p>
Studies show eating a healthy breakfast will improve your concentration and performance as well as your endurance and strength. </p>

<p>
Skip it and you’ll be exhausted in no time. </p>

<p>
But getting a breakfast isn’t just about gulping down your cup of coffee, eating a big doughnut to satisfy your sugar needs and rushing to the office. </p>

<p>
What should you have for breakfast? </p>

<p>
Think quality protein and slow sugar. </p>

<h3>Make lean protein part of your breakfast</h3>
<p>Add protein to your breakfast to keep you feeling full until lunch. </p>

<p>
"Protein blunts your hunger the most, and is the most satiating," Purdue University researcher Wayne Campbell, PhD, says in an interview to WebMD. </p>

<p>
So how can you best add protein to breakfast? </p>

<p><mark>
The traditional breakfast of eggs remains one of the best option. Eggs at breakfast will delay hunger and keep you feeling full longer than many other types of food. Eggs contain some of the highest-quality protein. </mark></p>
<h3>Bored of eggs? Some other healthy protein strong options:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A large apple or banana with a spoonful of peanut butter (the protein from the peanut butter will slow down the absorption of sugar from the fruit)</li>
<li>1 packet of PLAIN instant microwave oatmeal (note -do not buy the flavored kinds as it has more sugar.  Bonus points if you add nuts and low fat milk to it) </li><li>
A handful of almonds or walnuts</li><li>
A small carton of plain, low sugar yogurt</li></ul>
<p>At the very least, grab an apple and slice of a turkey or smoked salmon to start your day.</p>
<h3>Breakfast items to avoid (consider them your energy sabotagers)</h3>
<p>Doughnuts, waffles, pancakes, and sweet starches are ‘sugar crash’ foods. They will spike your energy and then deplete you, draining you of power and also making you hungry again within 2 hours, right about the time the office candy jar starts winking at you.</p>
<p>Keep this checklist in mind while shopping :
<ul><li>Strive for slow sugar</li><li>
 Add quality protein</li><li>
 Avoid sugar crash </li></ul>	

<h3>Today’s Task</h3>
<ul><li>Your task is simple. <mark>Keep drinking a cup of water as soon as you wake up. Then eat a grea, high protein breakfast. Do it for 3 days. </mark></ul></li>
<p>Ready? Press the 'I Accept' button below :

<p>

Preparation is key</p>
<p>Go to the supermarket today or tomorrow(or order  online) enough oatmeal, eggs, and fruit to have a power-packed breakfast for the whole week.</P>

<p>That's it for now, Fabulous Traveler. In our next letter, we'll speak about the next step in making your life more fabulous.</p>

<p>
P.S. : Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology and was portrayed in the movie "A Dangerous Method", rose at 7:00 A.M and spent a long time preparing breakfast, which usually consisted of coffee, salami, fruits, bread and butter,’ wrote the biographer Ronald Hayman. </p>

<p>This is the perfect morning breakfast combo: </p>

<p>
Coffee, salami, fruits, bread and butter. </p>

<p>
The best part of it? Time for contemplation. </p>
