<p>
A few years ago, I was what you’d call a hard-driven executive— putting in the long hours, eating lunch at my desk. “Life balance! What a joke!” I would say to my colleagues.</p>
<p>Until one special night…</p>
<p>

I went out with friends and I found myself sitting next to a person I was very interested in. But when I turned to him to start talking…</P>
<p>Nothing came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>
I was empty. My brain was foggy. </p>
<p>

After slogging so hard all those years — convinced that it would get me to my goals quicker— all I’d ended up with was a burn-out shell of a persona. </p>
<p>

That was my wake-up call. </p>
<p>

That was when I learned a vital lesson of behavior change — take time to celebrate. </p>
<p>

You can’t just forge ahead without stopping to relax or enjoying your successes — What’s the point? Achieving endless aims without appreciating your progress along the way is meaningless. Does anyone want that kind of life? </p>
<p>

Aaha Traveler, Take time to celebrate your realizations. </p>
<p>

Make time to enjoy the small successes of every day. </p>
<p>


“But what if I didn’t do anything heroic today?” I can hear you asking. </p>
<p>

Each day that you’re ingraining good habits into your life you’re being fabulous. And every effort you make deserves to be properly celebrated. </p>
<p>

Let’s see what science says about this. </p>
<h3>Habits</h3>
<p>Habits start to became ingrained when they’re associated with a delightful follow-up emotion. But whether this emotion is pre-built into the habit or you create it for yourself, as soon as you complete a healthy habit, even a small one, you should immediately celebrate your success. </p>
<p>
Stanford university professor and habit expert B.J. Fogg first popularised the celebration concept. It’s really very simple... </p>
<p>
Celebrating immediately after completing a healthy habit creates a memory imprint in your mind. So over time you learn to associate the habit with the positive emotion. </p>
<p>
Don’t worry if at first you have to create the positive emotion yourself — eventually it will become second nature. </p>
<p>

Why is it so difficult to get rid of addictive habits like taking drugs or watching pornography? Because a positive, powerful feedback emotion kicks in immediately after the action. This feedback tells your brain it was great to do this habit— you felt happier, and it was really pleasant. </p>
<p>

In other words, you’re getting rewarded for a habit regardless of whether it could be very bad for your health in the long run. So you start getting addicted, trying to revive this positive emotion again, and again. </p>
<p>

We’re now going to reverse engineer this in order to reprogram your brain to feel great about healthy habits— even those that can be painful at first. </p>
<p>

Exercising comes to mind first. When you start exercising regularly, it feels like a monster you need to conquer every morning. You feel pain. </p>
<p>

But if you keep it up over a long period of time, you’ll come to enjoy those feelings of pain -they’ll become sources of pleasure and you’ll find yourself looking forward to your next exercise session. </p>
<p>

Enter the new you, Aaha Traveler! </p>
<p>

Take time to celebrate after each one of the habits, and after completing your entire ritual. </p>
<p>

Do it immediately after each habit you’ve done, and immediately after completing the entire ritual. </p>
<p>

If you begin and only do 5 push-ups to start with, celebrate that you have begun and that you accomplished those push-ups. </p>
<p>

When you complete the entire ritual, celebrate that feeling of achievement, and prepare yourself for a fabulous day! </p>
<p>

It’s very important to celebrate as soon as you complete the habit to associate the positive emotion with it. </p>
<p>

Can you see how this is going to rewire your brain, Aaha Traveler? </p>
<p>

What will happen next time you’re thinking about starting your morning ritual? </p>
<p>

You’ll remember the feeling of happiness. Memories of the celebration will come back to you. </p>
<p>

That’s why it’s so important to make your celebration really memorable— it’s not just a matter of thinking: “Well, I’m doing good.” If you don’t associate any emotion with it, it doesn’t count as celebration. There is a real science and art behind creating an impactful celebration that will scientifically change your habits. </p>
<p>

Find out what works for you — talk aloud to yourself, address yourself in the mirror, do a little dance or some other physical movement (think footballers celebrating a goal score) </p>
<p>

What’s important is to feel the rush of emotions through your veins. Feel the happiness going through you. — You’ve achieved your goals in spite of despite of all the obstacles. </p>
<p>

Celebrate, Aaha Traveler! </p>
<h3>How Can You Celebrate your Successes?</h3>
<p>
Do whatever works for you, but be sure that it’s really effective. Ask yourself: “Do I believe in this emotion? Or am I just faking it?”. </p>
<p>
Realize that just getting yourself to do five pushs-up every morning is a feat in itself. It means that you had the willpower to wake-up and to do those five push-ups. It’s an opportunity to celebrate. </p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>
<p>
For the next week, Each time you complete one of your fabulous habits, and at the end of the ritual…</p>
<p><center>

           Celebrate your success! </center></p>


<div style="background-color:#D9D9D9;border:1px solid #000000;text-align:center">
<center><b><p>Celebrate Your Success! </p></b></center>
<p>
Do it 3-days in-a-row to succeed


Celebrating immediately after completing a healthy habit creates a memory imprint in your mind. Over time you learn to associate the habit with the positive emotion. </p>
<lable style="background-color:#E21C52;" padding-top: 5px; id="acceptTab" onClick="success();">I ACCEPT</lable><br/><br/>
</div>

<p>
Be sure to feel the thrill of the emotion in your veins, so test several types of celebration to see what really works for you.</p>
<h3>You’re Reprogramming Your Mind</h3>
<p>
Are you starting to realize? You’re learning how to reprogram and rewire your brain, to make it do almost anything. </p>
<p>
This is one of the most important life skills, and you don’t learn it at school. </p>
<p>
Our brain plays games with us all the time. </p>
<p>

In The Aaha, we aim to teach you how to avoid these traps, and to realize the elasticity of your brain— you can make it do whatever you want. </p>
<p>

It’s all just about mastering your brain and emotions. </p>
<p>

And being persistent. </p>
