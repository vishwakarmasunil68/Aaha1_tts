<p>Fabulous Traveler, what kind of exercise can you do in the morning? </P>
<h3>First of all, think PLAY</h3>
<p>If you can put on some music and dance your way to fitness every morning, that's great! You'll have a good time, and at the same time, you'll be getting your daily dose of exercise. </P>
<h3>
Second thing, think COMPLEMENT</h3>

<p>Can you make your daily morning exercise into a part of something you already do in the morning? </P>
<p>If you can, get off one station before your normal stop for work and walk the rest of the way, and do this every morning. Going to work is already part of your daily routine, so alter it a bit to add some daily exercising fun. </P>
<h3>
Third thing, think SMALL</h3>

<p>Start small, very small. You don't have to work up a sweat at the beginning, especially if you haven’t exercised for a long time. Once you start to succeed, you can make things more challenging. </P>
<h3>
Fourth thing, think EASY ACTIVATION</h3>

<p>If you're planning to go to the gym every morning, and the gym is a 10-minute drive from your home, you're adding a layer of complexity to your life. You need to get into your car, drive to the gym and get out of the car, every morning. All of this makes the habit of exercising more difficult. </P>
<p>Now, we won't leave you without some more ideas for exercising, and none of them require a gym. </P>
<h3>The No-Gym Required Option</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Go for a walk outside and get some light</li>
<li>
Dance to your favorite music</li>
<li>
Do some light stretching</li>
<li>
Swing a light kettlebell</li>
<li>
Try skipping</li>
<li>
Do a few squats, push-ups and abdominal crunches</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Fabulous 7-Minute Exercise</h3>

<p>The Fabulous includes an intense 7-minute exercise that will make you feel super energetic for the whole day. </P>
<p>For these 12 exercises, you only need your own body weight, a chair and a wall.
This exercise routine was first described in an article in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal. </P>
<p> “There’s very good evidence that high-intensity interval training provides many of the fitness benefits of prolonged endurance training but in much less time,” stated Chris Jordan, the director of exercise physiology at the Human Performance Institute in Orlando, in an interview to NYT. </P>
<p>I realize, Fabulous Traveler, that this can be a little bit intense at first, so test yourself on it. </P>
<p>If you can't manage it, no big deal. You'll have plenty of time to get to it later, once you have built the foundations.</P>
