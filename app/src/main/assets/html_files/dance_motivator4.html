A young comic asked famous comedian Jerry Seinfeld how to improve his stand-up routine. Seinfeld answered the only way to keep creating better jokes is to write every day.</p>
<p>Seinfeld told the young comic to get a big daily wall calendar that has a whole year in one page, and hang it on a prominent wall so it would be seen every day. </p>
<p>The next step is to get a big red magic marker. For each day where he had done his task of writing, he has to put a big red X over that day. </p>
<p>"After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer each day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain." </p>
<p>"Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis. </p>
