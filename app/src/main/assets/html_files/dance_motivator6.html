<p>
Aaha Traveler, I need to have a word with you, especially if you haven’t yet started exercising in the morning. </p>
<p>
I have a solution for you, a solution that will guarantee you’ll get into the habit of exercising. </p>
<p>
First, I need you to do something: </p>
<p>
Please promise yourself that you’ll to experiment with this solution three times this week. Only then will you be able to see whether it's working for you or not. </p>

<p>
Ok, Aaha Traveler, let's get started : </p>

<p>
Start Small. </p>

<p>
Reduce the amount of exercise you promised to yourself. </p>

<p>
Start small, very small. </p>

<p>
If you promised to do 20 push-ups, minimize this promise. </p>

<p>
Just do one push-up. </p>

<p>
If you said you're going for a 30-minute run, minimize it. </p>

<p>
Just commit to a 30-second walk. </p>
<p>
Not enough, not challenging..."I can do better!" I can almost hear you say. Yes, but we're applying a very straightforward psychological trick that has been proven by study after study. </p>

<p>
When you wake up in the morning and think about everything you planned to do, you'd rather stay in bed than get on with your day. </p>

<p>
But if you think that you have only committed to do five push-ups or a one-minute walk, you won't feel overwhelmed. </p>

<p>
You'll see it as a pleasant way to start the day, a success that will kick-start the day in the best possible way. </p>

<p>
If you do this for many days in a row, something magical will happen. You will realize that you're no longer just doing five push-ups—you're doing 20. You will discover that the best part of your day is now that 10-minute walk you're taking every morning. </p>

<p>
If you keep doing this for many days in a row, something magical will happen. </p>

<p>
And one day, you will remember how you started all of this: with that one push-up or the one-minute walk that paved the way! </p>

<p>
The magic will happen, Aaha Traveler. </p>
