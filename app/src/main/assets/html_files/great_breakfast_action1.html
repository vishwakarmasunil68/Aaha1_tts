<p>I know, Fabulous Traveler, that sometimes you just don't have time to prepare a proper breakfast, but this should never be a reason to skip it.</P>
There are always instantly available options.
<P><h3>Apples and Bananas</h3>
What can be quicker than putting a banana or an apple into your bag and eating it on the way? These two fruits have a low glycemic index, which means that they will sustain you with energy throughout the day. Contrast this to a muffin, which will give you a spike of energy for around 30 minutes, and then you'll feel a crash. </P>
<P><h3>Energy and Protein Bars</h3>
Read the nutrition label when buying these, and watch out for those that contain fat and sugar. Don't buy candy bars but energy bars. </P>
<P><h3>Mixed Nuts</h3>
Keep an ample supply of almonds, raisins, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. All these provide a steady source of energy. You can put them in a box and grab a handful when you don't have time for breakfast. </P>
<P><h3>Not hungry in the morning? </h3>
What if you're not hungry in the morning Fabulous Traveler? If you're a night owl, you generally won't feel hungry in the morning. I used to be like this, but once I got into the habit of eating breakfast, it just become something I absolutely needed. </P>
Start with a light breakfast in that case, even a handful of mixed nuts will do.
