<p>Hi Aaha Traveler ,</p>
<p>Welcome aboard The Aaha! You are embarking on a journey of all around well-being: Happiness, health and mental clarity. The App will be here as your personal coach to support you along the way. </p>
<p>Give yourself 15 Days. We will suggest small healthy actions, backed by science, to take every day. </p>
<p><mark>In 2 weeks, you’ll have more energy, feel more fulfilled, be more productive, and will have built the lasting rituals for an AMAZING life going forward. </mark></p>
<h3>The Power of a Morning Ritual</h3>
<p>What did Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway, Steve Jobs and other high achievers have in common? </p>
<p>Morning rituals. </p>
<p>They woke up at the same time every day, and repeated the same set of habits.
Ernest Hemingway awoke each morning around 5.30am (yes, even if he’d been out late drinking) and immediately began writing, describing his morning ritual as starting well, “just as the sun began rising” and working until he felt he had gotten down all he had to say. </p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin started his day by asking himself : “What good shall I do this day?”. His answer was the foundation for how he spent the next 24 hours. </p>
<p>What about you? </p>
<p>What’s the first thing you do when you wake up? Do you check emails on the phone while still in bed? Scroll through Facebook newsfeed to see what everybody else is up to? It’s okay. Many of us used to do this. Our emotional states were one of constant anxiety and stress. </p>
<h3>What to do today ?</h3>
<p>Here’s your first tiny action to start your day.<mark> Drink Water as soon as you wake up. Try it for three days. </mark></p>
<p>Your body is dehydrated after 6-8 hours of sleeping.  By drinking water first thing you immediately begin to rehydrate, purifying your internal system and kickstarting the day. </p>

<p>The Fabulous will remind you to drink. Just press the “I Accept” button below. </p>

<div style="background-color:#D9D9D9;border:1px solid #000000;text-align:center">
<center><b><p>Drink Water,</p></b></center>
<p>Do it 3 times this week to succeed</p>

<p>
For the next 3 days, Drink Water when you wake up to kickstart your body and start your day with a success! </p>
<lable style="background-color:#E21C52;" padding: 5px; id="acceptTab" onClick="success();">I ACCEPT</lable><br/><br/>
</div>
<p>
And, this is just the beginning. Don’t add many habits at once. It’s better to start small and succeed. We build routines and habits by achieving quick wins. </p>
<h3>How can I ensure my success?</h3>
<p>Start tonight. Have a glass or a bottle of water ready by your bed (fill up a cup or bottle the night before). </p>
<p>If you’d like a water bottle suggestion, the Klean Kanteen is one of the best available choice now. </p>
<h3>Something to remember</h3>
<p>To successfully change your behavior, start by setting small goals and aim for a quick win that will inspire you to go further. </p>
<p>We’ll talk more about proper preparation in our next letter. </p>
<p>That's it for now, Fabulous Traveler. Believe it or not, you’re already well on your way --taking small steps toward big changes. </p>
<p>P.S. : We love hearing from you! Let us know if you have trouble implementing your first new tiny habit. Or share your stories of success! </p>
