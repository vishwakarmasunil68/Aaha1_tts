<p>Greetings Aaha Traveler,</p>
<p>How do you feel? We're experimenting a bit together during this first week to see what works. You will succeed on some days and not so much on others.</p>
<p>
You are now kickstarting the day by drinking water and eating a good breakfast. </p>
<p>

Today, we'll be adding a third tiny habit. </p>
<p>

As usual, it's scientifically grounded and it will benefit your whole day. </p>
<h3>Get Moving! And increase your energy level by 20%</h3>
<p>According to a University of Georgia study, even simple exercise can increase your energy level by 20%, stimulate your body and mind, and decrease fatigue by 65%.</p>
<p>
In addition to getting lean and limber, did you know that exercising is also a proven technique to improve your mind? </p>
<p>

"Exercise is really for the brain, not the body. It affects mood, vitality, alertness, and feelings of well-being." says John J. Ratey, MD, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in an interview to WebMD. </p>
<p>

Want to feel smarter? Move your body. You’ll improve your abs and your brain, making you even more fabulous. </p>
<h3>So, what kind of "exercise" are we talking about?</h3>
<p>Start small and integrate exercising into your already existing set of habits.</p>
<p>You can :</p>
<ul><li>Take a quick walk around your neighborhood</li>
<li>Put on your favorite tunes and dance around the house</li>
<li>Do an easy start-to-finish yoga routine</li>
<li>Swing a light kettlebell</li></ul>
<h3>What's today’s task ?</h3>
<p>Now powered by hydration and fuel, you have energy to get moving:</p>
<p><mark>Choose a low intensity exercise, and try to do it for the next 3-days. </mark></p>
<p>

Ready? Press the 'I Accept' button below : </p>
<p>

<div style="background-color:#D9D9D9;border:1px solid #000000;text-align:center">
<center><b><p>Exercise & Feel Great! </p></b></center>
<p>Do it 3 times this week to succeed</p>

<p>

Exercise as soon as you wake up, before other distractions can intrude. Once the day gets going, it's hard to get off the treadmill called life. </p>
<lable style="background-color:#E21C52;" padding: 5px; id="acceptTab" onClick="success();">I ACCEPT</lable><br/><br/>
</div>

<p>Take your pick for tomorrow. And.... </p>
<p>

Prepare tonight. </p>
<p>

If you’re walking, put your shoes by the door. If you’re dancing, get that playlist ready (it’s only 4 songs!). If you vote for yoga, put the mat out. </p>
<p>

It is crucial that you just START. You can always increase the intensity of your routine later. </p>
<p>

What we’re after right now is mini triumphs. Don’t feel like you need to start a gym membership today, a success today is defined by 5 minutes of movement. </p>
<p>
<mark>
Can you take a moment now to decide what exercise you'll be doing tomorrow?</mark></p>
<h3>Remember</h3>
<p>Exercising in the morning kickstarts your day in the most fabulous way. You're already enjoying your first success! Soon you'll be so enthralled by this morning activity you'll jump out of bed just to dance to your favorite music or go on your daily walk.</p>
<p>What a wonderful way to start the day - with happy wins! </p>
<p>

That's it for now Fabulous Traveler! If you're looking for a happy song to start your day, here's a Bob Dylan one. </p>
<p>

Happy walking, dancing, moving! </p>
<p>

P.S. : One great mind known to exercise was Erik Satie, French composer and pianist. </p>
<p>

On most mornings after he moved to Arcueil, Satie would return to Paris on foot, a distance of about ten kilometres, stopping frequently at his favourite cafés on route. According to Templier, "he walked slowly, taking small steps, his umbrella held tight under his arm. When talking he would stop, bend one knee a little, adjust his pince-nez and place his fist on his lap. The he would take off once more with small deliberate step. </p>
