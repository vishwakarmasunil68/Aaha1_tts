Greetings Aaha Traveler, .</p>
<P>
What a week! </p>
<P>
Did you drink water, eat breakfast, and get some exercise in your day? </p>
<P>

Today is a wrap-up of your first week of change. </p>
<P>

You’re building a Aaha foundation. And soon we will add more structure and milestones to continue improving your life. But right now, we want to focus these 21 days on anchoring these new habits. </p>
<P>

You drank water first thing in the morning, ate a great breakfast, added some light exercise. This is huge! For now, please don’t add another habit until these three have become second nature. </p>

<h3>Why you shouldn't add any more habits for now ?</h3>
<P>
Behavioral change is all about tiny habitual changes. This is why new year resolutions never work : “I’ll start by running tomorrow for 30 minutes, and do it for the whole week!”. </p>
<P>

Our new year resolutions tend to be ignited by a wake-up call: a sneering smile by a colleague, an eyeful of belly fat in the mirror... </p>
<P>

But it always goes like this: </p>
<P>
<mark>
You get that first surge of energy and take a firm resolve, but it soon falls apart. You lose that initial fiery intensity of change ignited. You either completely forget about your resolve or have it in mind constantly without acting on it.    </mark>
</p>
<P>
We unfortunately fall into this trap all the time. </p>
<P>

Just compare last year’s goals with this year's; you’ll find a disturbing similitude. Year after year, you seem to have the same goals: lose weight, start an exercise regimen, wake up earlier, etc. </p>
<P>

"The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life." said Muhammad Ali Clay, one of the greatest heavyweight boxers in sport history. </p>

<h3>What are today’s tasks?</h3>
<P>Today is vacation day. We will not add more habits until the first three are set in stone. </p>
<P>

If you just keep on doing these 3 habits, you’re ahead of most. You’re keeping yourself hydrated and nourished. These are key ingredients to sharpening your focus, feeling more energy and living a life of greater impact and purpose. </p>
<P>

Would you like to challenge yourself? Can you keep this Golden Triangle for 3-Days in a row? </p>
<P>

Press the 'I accept' button below : </p>

<div style="background-color:#D9D9D9;border:1px solid #000000;text-align:center">
<center><b><p>Drink Water, Eat a Great Breakfast & Exercise</p></b></center>
<p>Do it 3 times this week to succeed</p>

<p>

Get the Golden Triangle in place. </p>
<lable style="background-color:#E21C52;" padding: 5px; id="acceptTab" onClick="success();">I ACCEPT</lable><br/><br/>
</div>

<h3>Oh the places you'll go!</h3>
<p>Next time, we’ll learn some distinguishing characteristics of successful cities. We’ll talk about the horrors of snoozing, and we'll learn how to increase concentration and empathy.</p>
<P>
Seize your day, Aaha Traveler! .</p>
<P>
P.S. : That's all for now, Aaha Traveler. We won’t send you another letter until you send us a message letting us know you have the first three habits set in stone. .</p>
</P>
So remember: drink water, get a good breakfast, and do any low-intensity exercise. This is Your Golden Triangle for a better life. .</p>
<P>
Here's a final treat for you: .</p>
